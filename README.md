# BlueGrass Assessment

Hi there,

Thank you for taking the time to review my assessment.

For this build, I opted for a more vanilla approach, minimizing the use of external libraries to focus on demonstrating my core skills rather than relying on third-party solutions.

Had I been working with APIs, my approach would have differed slightly; however, I believe the current implementation effectively serves the intended purpose.

Due to my current workload, I faced some challenges in finding sufficient time to complete the assessment. In total, I spent approximately 10 hours on the project.

The most challenging part of the build was the data table. Typically, I rely on libraries for implementing data tables, especially when there is significant functionality involved. It has been a while since I built a responsive data table from scratch, so it was a great opportunity to refresh and hone my skills in that area.

I hope everything is to your satisfaction.
